# Demo: GenAI-Generated Fullstack Application

This demo code is generated by GenAI to demonstrate the capability of generating a simple fullstack application.

## Components

1. **product-api**: A simple Spring Boot backend for product REST APIs, listening on HTTP port 8080. The product database is stored in a non-persistent object.
2. **product-app**: A simple React frontend for product listing, addition, and deletion.

## Deployments

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Java** (tested on Oracle JDK 17) and an IDE like **IntelliJ IDEA** installed for the backend.
- Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed for the frontend. Tested on Node.js version 20.16.0 with npm version 10.8.1.

### Backend (product-api)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open **product-api** in IntelliJ IDEA as a project.
3. Run `RestfulApiDemoApplication.java` located under `src/main/java/com/example/demo`.
4. Optionally, use Postman to validate the product REST APIs:
    - **GET**: `http://localhost:8080/api/products`
    - **POST**: `http://localhost:8080/api/products/add?id=4&name=Product 4&price=12`
    - **DELETE**: `http://localhost:8080/api/products/4`

### Frontend (product-app)

1. Open a command-line window.
2. Navigate to the `product-app` folder.
3. Type `npm start` and press Enter.
4. The application will launch in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
